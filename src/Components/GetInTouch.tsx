I believe a safe, trusting and non-judgemental relationship with the right therapist, empowers clients to bring about permanent, positive change.  I understand it can feel overwhelming finding the support you need but please donâ€™t stop looking.

        I have a peaceful, comfortable therapy room near the centre of Wimbledon with free on-site parking. I offer short and long-term, in-person and online sessions but can be flexible with telephone and walking therapy sessions, depending on individual circumstances. Email or leave a phone message to arrange a free initial chat.
