    I am a fully insured, British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) Accredited therapist with over 10 years experience supporting people on a crisis telephone line, in a bereavement service, and with staff at a large NHS hospital and a college of further education.

My many years of working in a bereavement service have shown me how beautifully resilient humans can be even with the heaviest burden to carry. Understanding the mind/body connection and the power of acknowledging and releasing feelings, in a healthy way, was the turning point for my own physical and mental wellbeing and is the foundation for my therapy practice.  </p>

By drawing on my initial humanistic/existential training, together with a range of more mindful, creative and trauma focused tools, including Emotional Freedom technique, I will help you explore how you feel in the present, get some healthy perspective on how the past has affected the way you feel now, but ultimately look towards a brighter future. I will help you safely face your pain, let go of unhelpful behaviours and feel empowered to live a life with more ease.
